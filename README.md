# What ?

A simple program which makes use of OpenSceneGraph & GDAL to represent a 3D
scene with OSM data.

The first intent was to fetch the data from OSM using the overpass API using
libcurl, but the project has never been finished.

The main parts of the code here have been kindof stolen/copy-pasted from the
Internet around 10th july 2016.
